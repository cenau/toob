# toob
Chillwave playing statusbar app, as requested by [Rey](https://github.com/rey).

Currently plays whatever is live at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJ4gkVC6NrvII8umztf0Ow 

to build, you probably need to fix the provisioning profiles to your identity etc in xcode. 
you also need a youtube data api key, which you should make a new plist called 'keys.plist' in toob/toob, and set the key 'youtubeApiKey' to your key.
